# Cyber-Security-Network-Intrusion-Case-Study
Data is been given in csv files for different attacks like Satan, Smurf, Rootkit, Neptune, NMap, PortSweep, Guess Password, FTPWrite, Back, BufferOverflow and Normal. We appended all the files and create a new column Attack. We did the resampling of the big data based on the Stratified Sampling technique as the ratios of the different attacks is highly improportionate. This dataa is an example of imbalance dataset so we need to do some balancing using Oversampling and Undersampling techniques both for the Binomial Classification and the Multinomial Classification.
For Binomial Classification, we created attack variable with attack vs normal.
For Multinomial Classification, we created attck variable with normal vs Satan vs Smurf vs Rootkit vs Neptune vs NMap vs PortSweep vs Guess password vs FTPWrite vs Back vs Buffer Overflow.
We created our Machine learning models using the Logistic Regression Technique for the Binomial Classification which gave us the better accuracy, precision and other model evaluation metrics to get the best accuracy using the Confusuion matrix.
And for the Multinomial Classification, we found that the data was highly unbalanced for different attacks so we oversampled and undersampled our data to the median value of the value count, we used the KNN (K Nearest Neighbors) Algorithm to get the best accuracy using the Confusuion matrix, Grid search and Cross Validation techniques.
